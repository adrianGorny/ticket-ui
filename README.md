# TicketUi - "Train Ticket Machine" code challenge

This project simulates the basic user interface of a train ticket machine.
This app relay on redux pattern, all the business logic is inside effects.
That's why there are tests only for effects and reducers. 
I use the services only to make request to a specific endpoint.
For this code challenge, I added mock connection error logic to the restapi service.
